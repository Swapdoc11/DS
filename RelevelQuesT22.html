        /*
            K division
Problem Statement

Klaus thinks that he is a genius. Antonio wants to test Klausâ€™s IQ for that he asked him a problem.

Given an array A of size N and an integer, K. Antonio asked Klaus to divide array A into K nonempty subsequence. Such that each element of the array should be part of exactly one subsequence. Now the Goodness of this division will be equal to

Example:- For array A {2,4,3,6,1} dividing this array into two subsequence {2,4,1} and {3,6} the the Goodness of this division will be =(4-1)+(6-3)= 6.

Now Antonion wants the goodness of the division to be the maximum possible.

You have to help Klaus So that he remains a genius in front of Antonio.

Your task is to determine the Maximum value of Goodness of the division.

Note:-

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, the array A.
Output Format

Print the maximum value of Goodness of the division.
Constraints

1<=K<=N<=105
1<=A[i]<=109
Sample Input 1

6 2

2 4 3 6 1 3

Sample Output 1

7

Explanation of Sample 1

For test case 1

For getting maximum goodness one of the possible division is {2,4,3}, {6,1,3}

And goodness = (4-2)+(6-1)=7





Things to Note for the Candidate:



 You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.

The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.

Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output.

Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
