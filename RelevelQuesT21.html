        Vidhi and Rangoli
Vidhi and Rangoli



Vidhi is making rangoli for diwali. She is making a very different rangoli which is made up of N characters where N is even. the rangoli should only contain the characters a or b. The rangoli is palindromic in nature meaning it reads the same backward as forward.

Ankit is the younger brother of Vidhi and is very mischievous. He has replaced some of the characters in the rangoli with '/'. Now vidhi has to replace all the occurrences of '/' with either a or b such that the rangoli is palindromic in nature. The cost of replacing '/' with a is X and the cost of replacing '/' with b is Y. Vidhi has to replace '/' such that total cost of replacing all the '/' is minimum and the resulting string is a palindrome.

You have to find out the minimum cost. If it is impossible to convert the given string to palindrome, print -1.



INPUT Format:



First line of input will contain the number of test cases.

For each test case, there will be of three lines:

The first line is the string whose palindrome is to be constructed

The second line is the cost of replacing '/' with a that is X.

The third line is the cost of replacing '/' with b that is Y.



OUTPUT Format:



For each test, print a single integer on a new line: the minimum cost.



Constrains:



1 <= T <= 100

1 <= |S| <= 10^4

|S| is even

1 <= X <= 100

1 <= Y <= 100



Sample Input:



2

aba/bab/

4

6

aaaabbbb

12

34



Sample Output:



10

-1



Explanation:

Test Case 1: The only way to produce a palindrome is to replace the 4th character of the string with 'b' and 8th character with 'a'. The first replacement costs 4, the second costs 6, so the total cost is 4+6=10.

Test Case 2: There is no '/' character, and string is not a palindrome. We have no way to change it into a palindrome. Hence -1



Things to Note for the Candidate: You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.

The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.

Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output.

Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
